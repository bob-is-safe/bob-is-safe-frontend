# ZkBob-SAFE Integration
This project is a submission for the ETHGlobal Lisbon 2023 Hackathon. It is an integration of ZkBob into SAFE, which allows users to send direct deposits to anonymous addresses using SAFE.

## Project Overview
ZkBob is a privacy-preserving protocol that enables users to send funds to anonymous addresses. SAFE is a toolkit to take advantage of AA features. This project integrates ZkBob into SAFE, allowing users to send direct deposits to anonymous addresses using SAFE.

## How to Use the App (using our deployed SAFE app)
To use the app, you will need to go to SAFE and integrate the SAFE app in the Goerli testnet. You can do this by going to your SAFE wallet, selecting "apps" then selecting "My Custom Apps." Next, install https://bob-is-safe.on.fleek.co/ and follow the prompts to integrate the app into your wallet.

Once the app is installed, you can use it to send direct deposits to anonymous addresses using ZkBob.
